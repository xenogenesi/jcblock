# The first field is the one tested. It can be the telephone
# number or some other field in the caller ID string. It *must
# be* terminated with a '?' character. The Date-of-last-block
# field starts in the 20th column. Be sure to add the '----'
# characters to a new entry so that room to store the date is
# present on the line. Do not use tabs. The rest of the line
# (out to 80 chars) can contain a comment of your choosing.
# Examples (without the initial '#' chars!):
