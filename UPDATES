	Updates/Additions added after the initial submission:

	1 January, 2009: Added whitelist
	--------------------------------

        As a result of operational experience it became evident that
	the addition of a whitelist capability would be helpful. A whitelist
	file (whitelist.dat) contains entries containing the telephone numbers
	of calls the user definitely wants to accept. The program checks for
	caller ID matches of these entries first. If a match is found, the
	blacklist check is bypassed and the call is accepted.

	The issue came up when it was discovered that some telemarketers use
	cell phones! For cell phone calls, the 'NAME =' field in the caller ID
	string is always: 'Cell Phone   XX', where XX is the originating state
	designator (e.g., CA for California). So using the 'NAME =' field as the
	search string in a blacklist entry would cause all cell phone calls
	from the indicated state to be blocked! In addition, the telemarketers
	use several cell phones (probably as employees come and go), so using
	the 'NMBR =' field in the caller ID as the search string does not catch
	new cell phone callers. Adding a whitelist partially solves this
	problem.

	With a whitelist, the user can include entries that contain the cell
	phone numbers of calls they definitely want to receive from a specific
	state (e.g., CA). Then the cell phone 'NAME =' field for the state (e.g.,
	'Cell Phone   CA') can be used as the search string in a blacklist
	entry. With this arrangement all cell phone calls from the state will
	be blocked *except* the ones with numbers present in the whitelist.

	In certain cases it might be useful to run the program with just a
	whitelist or just a blacklist. The program was modified to support
	these cases. For example, a user might want to *only* accept calls
	from specific numbers. In that case only a whitelist is needed.

	Updates/Additions added after release jcblock_release_2-0

	26 July, 2010: Added libasound comment to README file
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Some user's computers did not have the libasound library or the
	asoundlib.h file installed. Text was added to the README file
	describing how to install these files using a distribution's package
	manager. Search the file for 'asound'. Some minor syntax changes to
	printf and fprintf arguments were made in jcblock.c to satisfy more
	strict type checking by recent versions of gcc.
	
	30 July, 2010: Added #ifdef's to allow conditional compile
	----------------------------------------------------------

	Added Do_TONES and DO_TRUNCATE #ifdef's to allow a user to compile
	the program with/without these features.

	9 August, 2010: Switched from the 5 key to the * key to avoid conflict
	--------------------------------------------------------------

	It is possible that an automatic caller would present a list of
	choices that included the 5 key ("press 1 for...press 5 for..."). If the
	listener pressed the 5 key a blacklist entry for the caller would get
	generated (if pressed within the listening window). To avoid this, the
	key was switched to the star (*, asterisk) key, which is (almost) never
	used.

	17 August, 2010: Added code to handle non-standard caller ID fields
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

	Sometimes a call is received in which the NMBR field is not ten digits
	and/or the NAME field is not 15 ASCII characters. Example:
	--DATE = 081310--TIME = 1930--NMBR = 0--NAME = Unknown--
	Some changes had to be made to the way the KEY-* code constructed a
	blacklist.dat record for this case.

	7 September, 2010 Added code to make sure a blacklist file is present
	---------------------------------------------------------------------

	I had it so the program would run if only a whitelist.dat was present
	(no blacklist.dat file). That didn't make sense -- if a call was not
	caught by a record in the whitelist it got answered anyway. If you
	want to block all calls not in the whitelist, put a single record in
	the blacklist that has a caller ID field that is always present (e.g.,
	'NMBR'). I also updated documentation in the README file.

	16 September, 2010 Added getopt() call to allow serial port selection
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	The default serial port is: /dev/ttyS0. A different port may be specified
	using call option -p. Example: jcblock -p /dev/portID
