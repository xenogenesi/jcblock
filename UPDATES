	1 January, 2009: Added whitelist
	--------------------------------

        As a result of operational experience it became evident that
	the addition of a whitelist capability would be helpful. A whitelist
	file (whitelist.dat) contains entries containing the telephone numbers
	of calls the user definitely wants to accept. The program checks for
	caller ID matches of these entries first. If a match is found, the
	blacklist check is bypassed and the call is accepted.

	The issue came up when it was discovered that some telemarketers use
	cell phones! For cell phone calls, the 'NAME =' field in the caller ID
	string is always: 'Cell Phone   XX', where XX is the originating state
	designator (e.g., CA for California). So using the 'NAME =' field as the
	search string in a blacklist entry would cause all cell phone calls
	from the indicated state to be blocked! In addition, the telemarketers
	use several cell phones (probably as employees come and go), so using
	the 'NMBR =' field in the caller ID as the search string does not catch
	new cell phone callers. Adding a whitelist partially solves this
	problem.

	With a whitelist, the user can include entries that contain the cell
	phone numbers of calls they definitely want to receive from a specific
	state (e.g., CA). Then the cell phone 'NAME =' field for the state (e.g.,
	'Cell Phone   CA') can be used as the search string in a blacklist
	entry. With this arrangement all cell phone calls from the state will
	be blocked *except* the ones with numbers present in the whitelist.

	In certain cases it might be useful to run the program with just a
	whitelist or just a blacklist. The program was modified to support
	these cases. For example, a user might want to *only* accept calls
	from specific numbers. In that case only a whitelist is needed.
